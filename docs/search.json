It utilizes a refined classification system containing 35 land-cover categories and covers the time span from 1985 to 2022. Before the year 2000, the update cycle was every 5 years, while after 2000, it is updated annually. In specific, it developed by combining the continuous change detection method, local adaptive updating models and the spatiotemporal optimization algorithm from dense time-series Landsat imagery, and was validated to achieve an overall accuracy of 80.88% (±0.27%) for the basic classification system 10 major land-cover types) and 73.24% (±0.30%) for the LCCS level-1 validation system (17 LCCS land-cover types).\n#> - field(s): \n#> type, id, stac_version, description, links, stac_extensions, Theme, version, doi, layer_unit, contact_name, contact_email, date_offset, sld_url, qml_url, title, extent, license, keywords, providers\nlinks(glc, rel == \"item\")\n#> ###Links\n#> - links (26 entries(s)):\n#>  1 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_19850101_19851231/lc_glc.fcs30d_19850101_19851231.json)\n#>  2 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_19900101_19901231/lc_glc.fcs30d_19900101_19901231.json)\n#>  3 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_19950101_19951231/lc_glc.fcs30d_19950101_19951231.json)\n#>  4 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20000101_20001231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20000101_20001231.json)\n#>  5 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20010101_20011231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20010101_20011231.json)\n#>  6 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20020101_20021231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20020101_20021231.json)\n#>  7 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20030101_20031231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20030101_20031231.json)\n#>  8 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20040101_20041231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20040101_20041231.json)\n#>  9 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20050101_20051231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20050101_20051231.json)\n#> 10 [item] \n#> (./lc_glc.fcs30d_20060101_20061231/lc_glc.fcs30d_20060101_20061231.json)\n#>   ... with 16 more link(s).\nglc_items <- read_items(glc, progress = FALSE)\nglc_items\n#> ###Items\n#> - features (26 item(s)):\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_19850101_19851231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_19900101_19901231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_19950101_19951231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20000101_20001231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20010101_20011231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20020101_20021231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20030101_20031231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20040101_20041231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20050101_20051231\n#>   - lc_glc.fcs30d_20060101_20061231\n#>   - ... with 16 more feature(s).\n#> - assets: lc_glc.fcs30d_c_30m_s, qml, sld, thumbnail\n#> - item's fields: \n#> assets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\nitems_datetime(glc_items)\n#>  [1] \"1985-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"1995-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#>  [4] \"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2001-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2002-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#>  [7] \"2003-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [10] \"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [13] \"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [16] \"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [19] \"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [22] \"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n#> [25] \"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\nitems_assets(glc_items)\n#> [1] \"lc_glc.fcs30d_c_30m_s\" \"qml\"                   \"sld\"                  \n#> [4] \"thumbnail\""},{"path":"openlandmap-stac.html","id":"spatial-overlay","chapter":"5 OpenLandMap STAC","heading":"5.2 Spatial overlay","text":"overlaying multiple new points COGs, can leverage rstac function assets_url() retrieve URLs COG files.
