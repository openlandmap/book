# OpenLandMap Open Land Data services

[OpenLandMap](https://openlandmap.org) are Open Land Data services providing access to spatial layers 
covering global land mass (at spatial resolutions of 1 km, 250 m or finer) hosted by the OpenGeoHub foundation, GILAB.rs and collaborators. 
It aims at becoming an [OpenStreetMap-type system for land data](https://towardsdatascience.com/everybody-has-a-right-to-know-whats-happening-with-the-planet-towards-a-global-commons-5a1ad4ba0bdd). Access to spatial layers is 
possible via interactive visualizations and/or Open Source software solutions.
